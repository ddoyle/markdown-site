**It’s risky, trying to proof-read your own writing.** Your eyes cleverly
‘auto-correct’ a high proportion of the typos — and thinkos — because
they know what you intended to say. And the flaws remain.

Yet a professional editor, overriding this subconscious ‘skill’,
will focus on what you actually wrote — or seemed to imply — and
help you to clarify and enhance it.

Don’t leave the error-spotting to your clients and customers,
examiners, followers, interviewers, managers, sponsors, staff,
students, tutors …

Let Our Project sort it all out for you.

Our work is always tailored to the client’s requirements, but there
are two fundamental services:

**Proof-reading** We tidy up spelling, punctuation, formatting, and
resolve inconsistencies — but leave the content pretty-well unchanged.

**Copy-editing** As well as tidying up spelling, formatting and so on,
we suggest enhancements to the wording and structure: moving things
about, modifying tone, length, register, and so on.  The charges
for the two services are the same — but the copy-editing is a longer
job.

The principal editor at your_project.org is Mr. Π, a Cambridge
English MA with thirty years’ editorial experience, decades of
teaching English at a respected secondary school, and a lively
interest in all kinds of writing.
