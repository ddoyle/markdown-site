Editorial work is charged by the minute, with no minimum charge.

In our first contact we’ll establish what you’re working on and
what kind of help you’re looking for, and what we typically charge
for that.

Then you’ll send an e-mail — with no obligation — attaching a typical
sample of the material you want us to look at. We use Microsoft
Word.

We’ll edit / proof-read and return a section — free of charge — so
you can see what benefits you’ll be getting. You’ll also get a sense
of the likely time-scale (and hence expenditure) for the job.

If you decide to proceed with Wordfix, we’ll talk, and find a
mutually-agreeable schedule for completion / payment.

Clients typically pay by BACS, but some still use cheques, and
PayPal is another possibility.

Why don’t we charge by the word? Because it doesn’t help either
party. Sometimes 1,000 words need almost no modification, and
sometimes a single paragraph can require lengthy consultation or
research to sort it out.
